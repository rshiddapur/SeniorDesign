## Setting up your development environment

### Arduino IDE and Visual Studio Code Setup

First, download the [Arduino desktop IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) and follow the instructions for setup.

Try to download the hardware setup code and run it from this IDE on the bot to make sure everything's working.

You'll need to make sure you set the board to Arduino/Genuino Uno and the serial port to COM5. Verify the code and then deploy it to the board.

Then, install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and install the Arduino extension. You should be able to verify and deploy from here as well!

### Installing Command Line Git

First, download [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) or use a package manager to install Git on MacOS.

Check if the installation was successful by running the following in the command line: 
```bash
git --version
```
